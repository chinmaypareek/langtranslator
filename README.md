Problem:

Your web application should be accessible through the following API endpoints -
1. An API which enables users to upload the farmer list via a csv file and translates the
data into supported languages. Sample list here. Download the sample list as a csv to
test out your solution.
2. An API which allows us to retrieve all farmer data in the subset of languages specified
above.

Set-up Guide:

1. Clone the repositery to your local syatem
2. Import the project into code editor and install all dependencies using 'npm i'
3. Add .env into root directory of the project and add google API_KEY and mongodb credentials.
4. Run the node server from the terminal using 'npm run dev'
5. Then you can test the API's
